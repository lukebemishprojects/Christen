## Licenses

This tool is licensed under the LGPL 3.0 license.

The standalone executable jar bundles other libraries which do much of the heavy lifting -- notably, NeoForge's
[JavaSourceTransformer](https://github.com/neoforged/JavaSourceTransformer/) and [SRGUtils](https://github.com/NeoForge/SRGUtils),
the [IntelliJ platform](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community), and [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/). Note that the
standalone jar bundles code from these other projects, available under their own
licenses.
